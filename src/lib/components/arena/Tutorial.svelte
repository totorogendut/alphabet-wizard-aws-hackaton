    <li>
      Type <kbd>gather</kbd> followed by the name of resource to gather them. Buy
      items to make it easier to kill waves of enemies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Type <kbd>attack</kbd> followed by the name of the enemy to attack them.
    </li>
    <li>
      The game moves one turn every time you type into the command input. Every
      turn, enemies will move toward the bottom and they will deal damage to you
      once they reach the bottom of the arena (green section).
    </li>
    <li>
      Pressing <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd> will clear the command,
      effectively wasting the turn used typing the cleared command.
    </li>
    <li>
      Killing enemy gives you score, exp, and resources. Kill as many as enemies
      you can before your health (the big number above resources) goes down to
      zero!
    </li>
    <li>The longer the game goes on, the stronger the enemies get!</li>
    <li>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> This is not the final version of the game! Many features
      like spells and buffs mechanism simply don't land on the hackaton due to time
      constraint. I'll consider completing it if there's enough interest after the
      hackaton is over.
